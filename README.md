# Text-Mining
This project explores the lyrics of The Beatles using natural language processing techniques. It includes steps such as text cleaning, stopword removal, lemmatization, and word frequency analysis. Visualizations like bar plots and word clouds highlight the most frequently used words across albums, years, and songwriters. The project provides insights into lyrical trends and themes throughout the bandâ€™s discography.
